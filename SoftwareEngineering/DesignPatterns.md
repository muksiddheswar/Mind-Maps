# Design Patterns

### Creational

Create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. 
This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.

- `Abstract factory` groups object factories that have a common theme.
- `Builder` constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
- `Factory method` creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
- `Prototype` creates objects by cloning an existing object.
- `Singleton` restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.
